#Bug-gily bug-gily bug-gily bugs!

- can only calculate 2 numbers at a time. Before calculating another pair of numbers, one should press AC button.
- the following buttons does nothing:
  a. dot button
  b. percent button
- the positive/negative button only works for the first inputted number..
- if one failed to press the AC button (to enter another pair of numbers) and continuously press different buttons like add, subtract, 
or equals, etc... random things happen!

will fix bugs.. on Christmas break. \m/

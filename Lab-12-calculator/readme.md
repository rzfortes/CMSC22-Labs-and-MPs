----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug-gily bug-gily bug-gily bugs!
- can only calculate 2 numbers at a time. Before calculating another pair of numbers, one should press AC button.
- the following buttons does nothing:
  a. dot button
  b. percent button
- the positive/negative button only works for the first inputted number..
- if one failed to press the AC button (to enter another pair of numbers) and continuously press different buttons like add, subtract, 
or equals, etc... random things happen!

Note: should change how to implement other functions.. the efficient way

will fix bugs.. on Christmas break. \m/
